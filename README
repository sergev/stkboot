StkBoot boot loader offers the possiblity to download application
software via the serial UART interface into the internal flash memory
of Atmel AVR ATmega microcontrollers, without the need for an ISP adapter.
The used protocol is STK500 compatible.

Implemented protocol is secure: no code from flash memory can be read
until the chip is erased.

Memory size for atmega128 is 2024 bytes.
